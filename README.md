# Tips on learning

These tips are based from personal experience and from the course on [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by [Barbara Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley).

## How to avoid getting stucked?

When learning something new, it's common to get stucked on something. The easiest way to avoid getting stucked is to take a break. Basically, do anything that would detach you from what you're doing. It could be exercising, walking, talking with friends, taking a bath, or even sleeping.

Taking a break allows your brain to be form random connections which might lead to new solutions you've never imagined before.

Sleeping is also very powerful at preventing getting stucked. You might even dream about the material your studying if you focused long enough before sleeping. This allows your brain to process what you're learning and could give your better understanding of the material.

A good rule of thumb is to take a break or do something else whenever your stucked.

## How to avoid procrastination?

Procrastination is triggered by a discomfort in doing something. For example, we might think how painful and tiring it would be to exercise! This idea alone might prevent us from exercising.

This is also true in learning. We procrastinate on learning something that might benefit us in the long run because our brain "hurts" just be thinking about it.

A good rule of thumb is to just get started at doing something and eventually, you'll realize that the discomfort would slowly fade away.

## How to break a bad habit?

To break a bad habit, you must understand what triggers the bad habit. A habit has 3 parts.

1. The Cue. The cue is what gives your brain a starting point. For example, you see your phone and you immediately think of cat and dog videos.

2. The Routine. The routine is what you do when you get your cue. For example, you open the Facebook or Instgram app and start scrolling to watch cat and dog videos.

3. The Reward. A habit wouldn't be complete without the reward. See, you do something because it's "fun". You wouldn't do something without enjoying it. Who doesn't like cat and dog videos?

Before you knew it, you already spent at least an hour scrolling and watching videos.

To break a bad habit, it is important to understand the cue the triggers it. From the example above, the cue is your phone. Whenever you see your phone, you imagine of watching cat and dog videos and how fun it would be.

The next step to breaking a bad habit is to eliminate the cue. For example, you can hide your phone somewhere to prevent yourself from seeing it while you're learning. That's it.

Also, it's really important to keep at it. It would be difficult at first to prevent yourself from falling into that habit again, but if persevere, you'll break that nasty bad habit!

## How to create a good habit?

A good habit also has 3 parts, namely the cue, routine and reward. To create a good habit, you must create a cue for your brain to trigger the habit.

For example, you want to create a habit of running regularly. Firstly, you can set aside a time for running. That could be every morning after you wake-up.

Second, setup a cue for your brain to know that "it's time for running." That could be your shoes. Put it somewhere you can easily see in the in the morning so that you'r brain immediately gets the idea of running.

Third, you must actually perform the routine, namely running. Eventually, your body will reap the reward because you'll be healthier, and that's your reward.

Another important part of creating a good habit is the belief. You must believe that you can accomplish something if you keep doing it.

## How to avoid distractions?

Everyone is different and may have different ideas about distraction. Some can study on a busy coffee shop where the ambience is nice. Some likes to study in quite library.

Whichever you prefer, you must be in an environment that minimizes distraction and allows you to focus on studying.

If noise is distracting for you, you can get yourself a noise cancelling headphones to minimize the noise in your environment.

For me, listening to jazz and lofi helps me get into the mood of studying.
